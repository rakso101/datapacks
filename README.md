Hello and Welcome to where I put my Datapacks

--MiniMap--
Minimap is a bare bones datapack and resourcepack using shaders to move the position of a letter onscreen based on the players movement.





--UI Tools-- 
Right now this pack adds functionality to position and resize font pngs by setting their colour.

After installing the datapack and resourcepack use the following command to position the elements:

```team modify ui_001 prefix [{"text":"\ue000","color":"#f08080"}]```

The green and blue channels control the x and y position respectively. This is done as a poportion of the screen so the aspect ratio of the screen will affect the postion of the element.

--Rotate Scale Text Effect--
This is a barebones shader with cool texts effects based on the color of text in the title for 1.20.4

This command is a good idea of what is possible
```/title @p title [{"text":"\ue001","color":"#e50000"},{"text":"\ue001","color":"#e40000"},{"text":"\ue000","color":"#e30000"}]\```

--Portal effect--
This is a 1.20.4 resourcepack and datapack that adds a portal effect to the screen using custom fonts and the redertype_text core shader.

--Shader Selector (Zoom)--
A modified version of cloudwolfs shader selector to apply a zoom in effect. 1.20.4
